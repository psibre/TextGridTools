TextGridTools
=============

TextGridTools is a free Python package for processing, querying and manipulating Praat TextGrid files. TextGridTools improves on many deficiencies of Praatâ€™s embedded scripting language by providing a clean data model for TextGrid objects and their attributes, and offering functionality for common annotation-related tasks, for instance calculation of interannotator agreement measures. Owing to seamless integration with other Python tools, such as data analysis libraries and interactive interpreters, users gain access to a versatile and powerful computing environment without the need of repeated format conversions.
